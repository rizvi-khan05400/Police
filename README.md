# Traffic Stop Data Analysis 🚓

## 📌 Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset of police traffic stops to explore patterns related to violations, driver demographics, and stop outcomes.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed columns containing only missing values.  

2. **Speeding by Gender**  
   - Compared the number of male vs. female drivers stopped for speeding.  

3. **Gender and Searches**  
   - Checked whether gender affects the likelihood of being searched during a stop.  

4. **Mean Stop Duration**  
   - Converted categorical stop durations into numeric values.  
   - Calculated the average stop duration.  

5. **Age vs. Violations**  
   - Analyzed the age distributions for different types of violations.

## 📊 Findings
- **Men** were stopped more often for speeding than **women**.  
- **Men** were searched more frequently than **women** during stops.  
- The **average stop lasted about 12–13 minutes**.  
- **Younger drivers** were more likely to be involved in speeding, while **older drivers** appeared more in other violations.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
- **Male drivers** are more likely to be stopped for speeding and searched compared to **female drivers**.  
- The **average traffic stop lasts around 12–13 minutes**.  
- **Age** influences the type of violation committed.
